# Car databse Project Overview

This code appears to be a JavaScript script that implements a web application for managing a car database. It includes functions for creating car objects, adding them to a server, retrieving them from the server, and displaying them in an HTML table. It also includes a function for searching the database by license plate number and displaying the results. Finally, it includes event listeners for buttons that trigger various functions such as adding a new car, searching for a car by license plate number, and resetting the database display.
